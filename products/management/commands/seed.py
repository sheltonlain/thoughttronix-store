"""Seed the ThoughtTronix demo world.

Destructive and idempotent: every run wipes the catalog and the demo
accounts, then rebuilds the identical demo world. Run it whenever the
database should return to a known state.

Demo logins (documented in the README):

    admin / admin123          superuser
    employee / employee123    staff, "Junior Thought Curator"
    marketing / marketing123  staff with the manage_coupons permission
    customer / customer123    a plain customer, with order history, a live
                              cart, and two saved addresses

Five coupons show every coupon state, dated relative to the day the seed
runs; SPRING-SALE has expired after a run of real (seeded) use.
