# CLAUDE.md — The ThoughtTronix Store

A server-rendered Django 6 storefront and back office. The PRD (`prd/core-platform.md`) and the plan (`plans/core-platform.md`) record how the core platform was designed and built.

## Commands

- `uv sync` — install dependencies (Python 3.13, managed by uv)
- `uv run python manage.py migrate` — apply migrations
- `uv run python manage.py seed` — reset the database to the demo world
  (destructive, idempotent)
- `uv run python manage.py tailwind runserver` — dev server + Tailwind watch
- `uv run python manage.py tailwind build` — compile production CSS
- `uv run pytest` — run the test suite
- `uv run ruff check .` and `uv run ruff format .` — lint and format

## Project layout

- `config/` — the project package (settings, root urls)
- `accounts/` — custom user model (`accounts.User`, `AbstractUser` + nullable
  `job_title`). Roles are Django's own vocabulary: customers are plain users,
  employees are `is_staff`, the admin is `is_superuser`. No role field, no Groups.
  Marketing is staff holding the `coupons.manage_coupons` permission, granted
  to each user directly.
- `products/` — catalog (`Category`, `Product`, `Tag`), its back-office CRUD,
  and the `seed` command
- `orders/` — cart, checkout, orders, and back-office order management
- `coupons/` — promotional coupons: the `Coupon` model and its rules
  (`Coupon.objects.for_code()`, `coupon.evaluate()`), and Marketing's
  back-office Coupons tab
- `dashboard/` — the staff analytics dashboard
- `PROMPTS.md` — the AI-usage log; append entries, never rewrite history
- `templates/` — project-level templates (`base.html`); app templates live in
  `templates/<app>/`
- `assets/` — static sources; `assets/css/source.css` is the Tailwind input,
  `assets/css/tailwind.css` is compiled output (gitignored, never edit)

## Architecture convention

Logic lives in models and managers; cross-model workflows get a service
module; views stay thin.

Exactly two deliberate deep modules, docstrings and type hints on every
public function: `orders/services.py` (`place_order`, which applies a
`coupon_code` via `coupon.evaluate()`) and `dashboard/queries.py` (the
dashboard's aggregations). Coupon rules live on the `Coupon` model, not in
a third deep module; checkout's Apply preview and `place_order` share
`evaluate()`, so the price shown is the price paid.

Idiomatic Django throughout: class-based views, model methods, custom
managers/querysets, forms own their validation. Settings read from `.env`
via environs with working defaults — the app must run with no `.env` present.

## Template conventions

- Every page extends the project-level `templates/base.html` (DaisyUI navbar,
  footer motto). DaisyUI theme: `night`, set in `assets/css/source.css` and
  `data-theme` on `<html>`.
- Back-office pages extend `templates/backoffice/base.html` — the staff shell
  with the tab rail; the active tab comes from the view's `section` context
  entry.
- HTMX endpoints render partials from `templates/<app>/partials/_<name>.html` —
  prefixed with an underscore, never extending `base.html`.
- Every list view gets a designed empty state, not a blank page.
- Styling is Tailwind + DaisyUI classes only; no crispy-forms, no JavaScript
  beyond HTMX.

## URL conventions

- Every URL is named; every app has a namespace (`products:catalog`,
  `orders:checkout`).
- Public catalog URLs use slugs (`/products/seraphine-home-hub/`);
  back-office URLs use pks.
- `Product` defines `get_absolute_url`.

## Testing

pytest + pytest-django. Shared fixtures live in the project-level
`conftest.py` — plain fixtures, no factory-boy. Tests never invoke the seed
command. The suite must be green at every phase boundary.
